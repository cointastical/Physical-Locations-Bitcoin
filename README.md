Physical Stores where you can Buy or Sell bitcoin

There are a number of foreign currency exchanges and other places where there is a "storefront"/branch and an actual teller or other staff where you can just walk up and do a bitcoin buy and/or sell.

Some of the following stores require KYC / Identity verification. When we learn which do require KYC, and which do not (i.e., [**NO KYC**]), we will update this list accordingly.

[Updated: 14 Jan, 2023. Note â€” there are some countries, such as Turkey, Ukraine, and others where there are numerous additional locations but we have no business names or location information on them.]
